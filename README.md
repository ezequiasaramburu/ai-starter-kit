# **AI Starter Kit**

Welcome to the **AI Starter Kit** ‚Äì a self-hosted, easy-to-integrate solution for adding powerful AI capabilities to your existing SaaS or web application. With this starter kit, developers can easily integrate AI-powered features, such as natural language processing, into their platforms with minimal effort.

## **üöÄ Project Overview**

The AI Starter Kit provides:

- **API endpoints** for interacting with AI models (such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, or custom models).
- A **CLI tool** to quickly install and configure the kit into your project.
- **Usage tracking** and **API key-based authentication** to secure your API.
- **Easy integration** with any existing backend system.
- **Self-hosted** solution that can be deployed on your own server or cloud.

This kit is designed for developers who want to add AI features to their applications without spending too much time on setup. Simply install the kit, configure your AI provider, and you're ready to go!

## **üì¶ Features**

- **AI Models Integration**: Supports popular models like OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4, Hugging Face, and self-hosted models.
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure your endpoints with API key-based authentication.
- **Rate Limiting & Analytics**: Control usage and monitor API calls.
- **CLI Installer**: Quickly install the kit into your existing project using a simple command.
- **Logging**: All requests and usage statistics are logged for tracking.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Installation**

### **Step 1: Install the Kit**

To install the AI Starter Kit into your project, simply run:

```bash
npx ai-starter-kit install
```

This will set up the necessary configuration files and dependencies for you.

### **Step 2: Configure Your AI Provider**

Once the kit is installed, configure your AI provider (e.g., OpenAI API Key or Hugging Face credentials) in the `.env` file.

Example:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-huggingface-api-key
```

### **Step 3: Start the Server**

Run the following command to start the backend API server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the API on your local machine. You can then begin integrating it into your application.

## **üîí Authentication**

API requests are secured using API keys. Make sure to include your key in the headers when making requests to the API.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, AI!"}'
```

## **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options**

You can configure the AI Starter Kit using the `.env` file. Below are some of the key configuration options:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (for GPT models).
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`: Your Hugging Face API key (for Hugging Face models).
- `RATE_LIMIT`: The maximum number of API calls per minute.

## **üìä Usage Analytics**

The kit tracks basic usage statistics, such as the number of requests made to the API. You can view this information by accessing the `/api/usage` endpoint.

## **üîß Deployment**

You can deploy the AI Starter Kit to any platform that supports Docker. Here are the steps to deploy using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t ai-starter-kit .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ai-starter-kit
```

This will make your API available at `http://localhost:3000`.
